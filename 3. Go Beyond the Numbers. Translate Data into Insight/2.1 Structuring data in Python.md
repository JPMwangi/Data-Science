## Structuring data.
The practice of structuring in exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps data science projects move forward. During EDA, when working with data that contains aspects of date and time, 'datetime' transformations are integral to better understanding the data. As a data professional, you will encounter datetime transformations quite often as you determine how to format your data to suit the problems you want to solve or the questions you want to answer. 
## To-Do
You will work with a dataset discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help you draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, you will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you will find in the dataset.
This will develop your skills in EDA and your knowledge of functions that allow you to structure data.
