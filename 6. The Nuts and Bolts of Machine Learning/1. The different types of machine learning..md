We'll explore the basic concepts of machine learning and the role of machine learning in data science. Then review the four main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and deep learning.
### Introduction
##### Introduction to Course 6
In this course you'll learn the process for creating complex models which can be used to offer suggestions about all kinds of things. For example, how programmers actually build trained algorithms to make predictions on the internet search browser. These models work by applying previously gathered data to make educated guesses about everything from dinosaurs, to the music you listen to, to the route you might take to work. Without talented data professionals and the machine learning models they create, we wouldn't have this useful feature. We'll  explore the major characteristics of machine learning, and keep developing skills in Python. 
Machine learning is the use and development of algorithms and statistical models to teach computer systems to analyze and discover patterns in data. Its applications are diverse. From optimizing microchip design and improving earthquake predictions, to recommending videos to watch on social media, and more. 
Knowing this will help you become a data professional who can use machine learning to work on applications. It may be helpful to review linear and logistic regression, statistical models since they are used in machine learning. The terms complex models and machine learning are often used interchangeably. Here, the term complex models is used to refer to mathematical or computational models in general, inclusive of everything from regression to deep learning. What we'll learn:
- The different types of machine learning
- How PACE applies to machine learning
- How exploratory data analysis (EDA) impacts machine learning
- Selecting proper models
- Selecting proper metrics 
- Python libraries and packages for specific types of machine learning
By the end of the course, you will have a virtual toolbelt packed with the tools you need to build and improve on complex models. You'll learn how to practice these skills on portfolio projects based on common workplace scenarios for data professionals. Machine learning is evolving and developing all the time with new applications everyday.
##### Helpful tips for course completion
Here is a list of best practices that will help you with the course:
- Plan your time: Setting regular study times and following them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to set achievable goals. Find a space that allows you to focus when you are getting the job done.
- Work at your own pace: Everyone learns differently, so design your schedule accordingly.
- Be curious: Act on every idea that gets you excited. Ask questions, search for more details online, explore the links that interest you, and take notes on your discovery.
- Take notes: Notes will help you remember important information in the future, especially as you are preparing to enter a new job field.
- Review exemplars: These are completed assignments that fully meet an activity's criteria.
- Chat responsibly with other learners.
- Update your profile: Consider updating your online profiles to include your photo, career goals, and more. This will help other learners know you better.
##### Delight people with data
Working uninterrupted for a long chunks of time will help you complete your work. Working with other people like software engineers, partners, product managers, etc. can help give you context in problem solving. Working as a data professional can help you have an impact on people's lives. You will work with different kinds of data, and measure it in many ways. Categorical responses are helpful and can be turned into binary category to classify outcomes. 
Making improvements on products you work on as a data professional has an effect on people's lives. Their experiences with the product gets better, and the product touches many people. Breaking into the field of data science can be very daunting. It can be a very intimidating field, where it feels like everyone has fancy models and big presentations. And you just don't know these things yet. By keeping at it, you will learn how to do these things.

You'll be tasked with solving a business problem using the provided data. To apply the concepts and skills learned.
##### The main types of machine learning
Logistic regression (or sigmoid function) and linear regression have different purposes. For example, when you discover data points are grouped into two different categories in a dataset, a logistic regression is a better fit for a dataset like that. Linear regression is particularly good for datasets in which data points can be presented with a straight line.
	![[3class distro.png|400]]
With some datasets, simple regression models may not be sufficient for your analysis. For example, the graph above shows the distribution of three classes. A simple linear regression model wouldn't be very useful if we didn't know what class our observations belonged to. A simple logistic regression wouldn't be able to predict a problem with three classes. This is where data professionals need more complex machine-learning. 
But many machine-learning models use regression principles as a foundational layer to begin the process of teaching a computer model to make decisions. Depending on the type of data available and the kind of problem you want to solve, you'll probably select one of two machine-learning types; supervised and unsupervised. Because supervised learning problems occur more frequently in the workplace, data professionals use this type most often.
###### Supervised machine learning
Supervised machine learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify or predict outcomes. Data professionals use supervised machine learning for prediction. Labeled data is data that has been tagged with a label that represents a specific metric, property or class identification. 
For example, imagine you need an algorithm to predict whether a bird is a penguin or an ostrich based on height. You have a dataset of heights, an indicator that specified whether that measurement came from a penguin or an ostrich. 
	![[labeled data.jpg|400]]
The height value is the X data. The indicator is the label or the Y data. 
Another example, you own a restaurant and you have data on how many customers visit per month and how much revenue you generate per month. If X is the number of customers and Y is the amount of revenue, then you can use an algorithm to predict next month's revenue based on the number of projected customers. Whether you're measuring birds or predicting revenue, you need labeled data for supervised machine-learning. 
Next, think about the terms classify and predict as they apply to supervised learning. We can use our bird and restaurant examples to help. The bird example requires an algorithm that seeks to classify or collect different types together into categories, classes, or groups. In the restaurant example about predicting revenue, the algorithm's goal is to forecast or estimate a value given data that is already labeled.
To summarize, supervised machine learning algorithms use data with answers already in it, and use it to make more answers either by categorizing or by estimating future data. As a data professional, you will manually adjust these types of models to meet business needs. Using your knowledge of data cleaning, statistics, and regression, you will learn to train, tune, and optimize complex models to deliver more accurate results.
###### Unsupervised machine learning
The other most common type of machine learning used by data professionals is unsupervised learning. Unsupervised machine learning uses algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data. In this type, data professionals ask the model to give them information without telling the model what the answer should be. At this point, you may have an idea of what unlabeled data means. Think back to the ostrich example discussed above. Unlabeled data would describe a set of flightless birds and not contain any labels, tags, or categorizations as seen below.
	![[Unlabeled data.png|400]]
When you receive a dataset like this, the goal is to group the birds by their similarity based on patterns detected by your model without there necessarily being a correct answer. Once an algorithm is deployed, unsupervised learning will manage data as it comes in and classify or analyze it. For example, when a news aggregator categorizes an article by topic or a media platform categorizes a video by genre, this is done by unsupervised learning algorithms. 
Its important to learn how these algorithms work on a conceptual level, how to implement them, and how to apply them to datasets you'll encounter on the job. 
###### other types of machine learning
Reinforcement learning is often used in robotics and is based on rewarding or punishing computer's behaviors. The computer will take action based on a policy or set of rules that it has learned. If the action results in a favorable outcome, it will be a reward. In an unfavorable outcome, the computer will receive a penalty. Based on whether it received a reward or punishment, the computer will update its policy trying to optimize for rewards or minimize penalties. The process will repeat until a satisfactory policy is found.
Deep learning models are made of layers of interconnected nodes. Each layer of nodes receives signals from its preceding layer. Nodes that are activated by the input they receive, then pass transformed signals either to another layer of to a final output.
Artificial intelligence includes all types of machine learning. Supervised and unsupervised learning are the most common applications of machine learning and having strong skills in these domains is valuable to potential employers. They use the same principles as reinforcement learning and deep learning. Here, machine learning falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. They refer to the same principle; training a computer to detect patterns in data without being explicitly programmed to do so.
One aspect of machine learning and data science that every data professional should know is quality is more important than quantity. A small amount of diverse and representative data is often more valuable for data professionals than a large amount of biased and unrepresentative data.
### Categorical versus continuous data types and models
##### Determine when features are infinite
Most activities that humans undertake in life are finite, in that, they have a beginning, middle, and end. Data professionals deal with infinity all the time. And this is also true when building complex models. Continuous features can take on an infinite and uncountable set of values. Continuous features can take on an infinite and uncountable set of values.
Understanding this concept is critical when selecting a machine-learning model and choosing the measurement to check that model's utility. For example, weight is a continuous feature or variable because it has an uncountable set of possible values. Conversely, counting the number of items in a collection of items is a fixed quantity. 
As a data professional, knowing whether the features you input into a machine-learning algorithm are continuous or fixed will be essential to choosing the correct model and the evaluation metric for that model. It is one among many of helpful indicators to consider when deciding which machine-learning model to use. Supervised learning models that make predictions that are on a continuum are called regression algorithms.
Data professionals use these types of models to work with continuous data. The goal of these models is to predict outcomes or values based on the datasets provided. The nature of a data professional's job in this case is to train the model to predict the values as accurately as possible.
##### Categorical features and classification models
Sorting candies by size and shape and color is pretty simple. It may seem like teaching a machine to sort wouldn't be that difficult. Whether or not a particular model is appropriate for a problem like sorting by characteristic is largely determined by what type of variable it must predict. Therefore, the purpose of a model is largely determined by the type of variable it must predict. 
We'll review a few types of variables that are helpful for determining the right supervised machine learning model for your data: 
- Continuous variables are variables that can take on an infinite and uncountable set of values. On the other hand, categorical variables and discrete variables are not continuous by nature. Rather, categorical variables contain a finite number of groups or categories. For example, you might use a categorical variable to classify a vehicle type like car, motorbike, or bus.
- Discrete variables, on the other hand, have a countable number of values between any two given values. In this way, discrete variables are unlike continuous variables, which are uncountable and have an infinite set of values. The height of a tree is a continuous variable, but the number of trees in a park is a discrete variable. Discrete variables are able to be counted and categorical variables are able to be grouped. For example, the paint color of a house is categorical, while the number of houses in a neighborhood painted lavender is discrete.
Supervised machine learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify or predict outcomes. Categorical classification and discrete variables are a part of that supervised learning definition. Many machine learning algorithms are trained using large datasets that group data inputs into two or more groups. Knowing what type of features you have in a dataset and what outcomes you are looking for will help you determine the most applicable machine learning model.
Lets consider an example from the manufacturing sector: You are a lead data scientist at a stuffed animal manufacturer. You're lucky to have an automated system which stuffs, stiches, and tags plush cats and dogs at the same time. The system was set up that way because the stuffed animals are sold in packs of twos, one cat and one dog. But now the retailer is requesting that cats and dogs be sold separately.
Rather than buying new parts to update the machine, the plant manager asks you to use a camera to identify the cats and dogs so they can be separated automatically. The algorithm of grouping the cats and the dogs based on images from a camera would use categorical data as part of a supervised machine-learning model. The algorithm will ask, is this a dog or a cat? You'll train the computer using the visual data to recognize and separate the incoming dogs and cats.
With that problem solved, you're asked to build a model to predict how many shipping containers are needed to ship all of the stuffed animals. This has a discrete target variable because you're counting a number of containers.
### Machine learning in everyday life
##### Guide user interest with recommendation systems
Recommendation systems are a subclass of machine learning algorithms that offer relevant suggestions to users. They are everywhere on websites and apps that matches you with something whether its an outfit to wear or a recipe to cook. The main goal of a recommendation system is to quantify how similar one thing is to another, and uses this information to suggest a closely related option. In this way, recommendation systems make it easier for users to find and connect with information, products, and content that's relevant and enjoyable.
###### For example: 
Have you ever been streaming your favorite new album when you reach the end, something entirely new begins to play? You've never heard it before but you really like it. How did your streaming service do such a good job for you? It used a recommendation system.
Lets examine how it works:
First, you selected a song on the music streaming service, then when the song ended, the service played more music related to your initial choice. This is an example of content-based filtering in which comparisons are made based on attributes of content itself. In this case, attributes of the music you played are compared to attributes of other music to determine similarity. To make this comparison, there must be data about each song that's a deconstruction of its attributes. In other words, everything that makes the song unique is identified and labeled, like an artist's voice type, the rhythm or beat, or whether a certain instrument is featured.
Then when you search for a song, the content-based recommendation system will access the list of attributes for that song and every other song in its library. Finally, the system will compare them all using the same list of attributes. Good song recommendation systems compare hundreds of attributes.
###### Advantages and drawbacks of content-based recommendation systems
They are easy to understand, they help recommend more of what the user likes, even niche things that few others are interested in, and they don't need information from any other users to work. Another advantage is that the filtering is not limited to comparing items, like songs. They can map users and items in the same space and then recommend things that are closest to a user's typical preferences. 
Interestingly, sometimes a benefit can be a drawback and vice versa. For example, the fact that content-based systems always recommend more of the same type of thing can be a drawback. Users wont be introduced to something that diverges from what they've selected in the past or learn something new. 
Another disadvantage is that the attributes often have to be selected and mapped manually for all the items, which is an enormous amount of work. Finally, content-based filtering is ineffective at making recommendations across content types, because different content types don't use the same features. For instance, a book doesn't have beats per minute, so the same streaming service won't be able to use your song preferences to recommend a new novel. The use cases can be limited. 
Note that in this music streaming example, you didn't actually rate anything, you just listened to your playlist and the algorithm found similar songs. When you stream videos on the other hand, you might rate or review something when you like it. The recommendation system can also use your feedback to suggest other videos you might like. This can also be a drawback because you probably like videos about various topics, but the system will use your feedback to only suggest similar videos to the ones you liked.
###### Collaborative filtering
Another example of how recommendation systems work based on your feedback is the collaborative filtering. When a user actively likes content by rating it or giving it a good review, it leads to collaborative filtering. A recommendation system will use collaborative filtering to make comparisons based on who else liked the content. Then it will suggest videos to someone else with similar preferences. 
Its different from content-based filtering in that the recommendation system doesn't need to know anything about the content itself, all that matters is it you liked it. 
###### For example: 
Perhaps you want to know which ice cream flavors David will enjoy. A collaborative filtering system would compare past items that he has liked to what other people have liked. Because David's likes and dislikes are very similar to Fatima's, the algorithm will predict that he'll enjoy fudge brownie because Fatima does.
Collaborative filtering system works regardless of what items are, the flavors don't matter. It doesn't even matter that's its ice cream. It could be cars or restaurants or hair products. All that matter is that Fatima and David have similar tastes. The ability to recommend across content types is one of the main advantages of collaborative filtering.
###### other benefits and drawbacks of collaborative filtering system
It finds hidden correlations in the data and it doesn't require tedious manual mapping. Drawbacks of collaborative filtering are that these systems need lots of data to even start getting useful results, and every user must give the system lots of data. Also collaborative filtering data is very sparse, which means it has a lot of missing values.
An example:
There are hundreds of thousands of movies in existence, but most people have only viewed a small fraction of them. Each person's movie data would have missing values for all the movies they haven't experienced. A recommendation system would need to use advanced filtering techniques to manage all that empty space.
Most recommendation systems are highly complex and use hybridized models that make use elements from both content-based and collaborative filtering. But even in the simplest use cases, there are different needs, resources, and strategies available for data professionals to use. It's the data professional's job to recommend the best problem solving approach.
##### Case study: The Woobles: The power of recommendation systems to drive sales
Data professionals use machine learning to discover patterns in data and make informed predictions. This case study describes how The Woobles, an online retailer based in Cary, North Carolina, uses machine learning and website analytics to grow their business and enhance customer experience. You'll learn how machine learning generates personalized product recommendations to save time and increase sales. You'll also learn how chatbots enabled by machine learning can improve customer service.
###### Company background
The founders established the Woobles to sell crotchet Amigurumi kits. Amigurumi is the art of crocheting (or knitting) miniature figures. They thought there must be a better way of making them which led to the creation of their website. Each kit offered in the online store contains everything anyone needs to be successful with crotchet amigurumi. The platform helps people prove to themselves (in a fun way) that they're capable of learning something new.
###### The challenge
E-commerce stores display product recommendations as links to products a customer might also be interested in purchasing. Product recommendations on the Woobles' website help drive product sales. The biggest challenge is making sure that the right products are recommended to the right customers at the right time, all in hope of increasing sales.
The Woobles gets some help from Shopify's machine learning. Businesses that implement product recommendations with machine learning don't have to worry about the details to create or personalize them for each customer; they can focus their time on other important matters. Entrepreneurs and business owners don't have time or expertise to develop their own recommendation systems. To them, these systems seem like a black box, but to data scientists who create them, they're quite understandable.
###### The approach
The Woobles relies on a combination of machine learning and analytics to ensure that product recommendations displayed to customers lead to the greatest increase in sales. By using an automated and manual approach to managing product recommendations on its website. Website metrics from Google Analytics and analytics data from Triple Whale inform both machine-based and human decisions about which recommendations to display.
###### Automated recommendations on product pages
The Woobles displays product recommendations at the bottom of each product page to encourage customers to continue browsing and shopping. Because The Woobles is hosted on the Shopify e-commerce platform, Shopify's machine learning algorithm automatically generates these recommendations. The algorithm relies on purchase history data to recommend products that have historically been purchased together. It also relies on product descriptions in the store to recommend products with similar descriptions.
These recommendation systems are a closely guarded proprietary secrets as they are very valuable in today's e-commerce landscape. They can make use of elements from both content-based and collaborative filtering. They also can make use of some natural language processing (NLP) techniques, as in this case here.
In this case, the algorithm might use content-based filtering to compare all of the items that The Woobles sells and assign each to a place in a featurespace. For instance, beginner-level kit might be closer to each other in this featurespace than expert-level kits.
At the same time, the model can use collaborative filtering in conjunction with average item scores on the website. For example, if a person shows interest in product A, and the highest similarity score from a content-based filtering approach returns product B with a 3.9-star rating, and product C is in second place by similarity score but it has a 4.9-star rating, it may combine this information to offer product C to the customer.
Finally, the algorithm uses NLP techniques to help determine product similarities. To do this, it might use a 'bag of words' technique. This is a method in which, for each product, the description is 'tokenized', or separated to its individual words, which are then used as features. The words are then counted. So, if the words 'needle', 'pattern', and 'expert' appear five, three, and two times, respectively, these counts are captured. This is repeated for all of the products, and the resulting word counts are put into what's known as a 'document-term matrix'--essentially a table with words as columns and products as rows. Then the algorithm calculates the distance between each product vector. There are many different ways to do this, and they can be very complex. Ultimately, the products with the least distance between them or the greatest similarity are then recommended.
###### Key benefits of Shopify's product recommendations
- Shopify generates the links to the recommended products and the process is automated using Shopify's machine learning algorithm.
- Shopify uses customer transaction data to ensure its product recommendations algorithm has up-to-date information when selecting products to recommend.
- The cost to increase sales via auto-generated product recommendations is minimal.
###### The results
Automated product recommendations enhance the customer shopping experience by helping them find relevant products, while maximizing cart order values. There are many ways that online retailers can try to increase sales, but implementing product recommendations is a cost-effective option that has been proven to pay off for The Woobles. In particular, product recommendations that are auto-generated by Shopify's machine-learning algorithm provides a personalized shopping experience to each customer. Customers save time by having product links presented to them, and this personalization is achieved without any manual work or additional time commitments by The Woobles staff. In fact, The Woobles estimates Shopify's product pages saves five hours per hour per month in manual labor since the process is automated through machine learning.
###### The future
Product recommendation isn't the only way for a small business to leverage machine learning. As their business has grown, so too has the number of questions related to product information, shipping, billing, and other routine aspects of commerce. A lot of time is spent responding to these inquiries. To help them, The Woobles would like to implement another solution enabled by machine learning: chatbots.
Chatbots are software programs designed to simulate conversations with human users, especially over the internet. The Woobles envisions that chatbots could help answer questions potential customers have after they watch any of the crotchet tutorials offered on the website. Chatbots can assist with certain aspects of customer acquisition, such as customer education.
Like recommendation systems, chatbots are highly complex, multilayer algorithms that make use of multiple techniques. For example,  chatbot might break down sentences into bags of words or 'n-grams' (combinations comprised of n number of words), then use unsupervised learning to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting vector matrix and cluster it, and use supervised learning to predict the words most likely to follow a given prompt. The result, ideally, is an experience that is indistinguishable from chatting with a human being.
###### Key Takeaways
Below is a summary of the main insights from this case study:
- Recommendation engines can use combinations of content-based and collaborative filtering. Products can be compared based on intrinsic similarities and offered based on collaborative satisfaction ratings. NLP can be used to help determine content-based similarity metrics.
- Businesses that implement product recommendations with machine learning save time. By using an ML-driven solution to product recommendations, The Woobles don't have to regularly spend time manually updating recommendations as new data and products come in.
- Analysis of current sales data and customer trends is critical in selecting the products featured in product recommendations. An automated approach to managing online product recommendations is an effective component of The Woobles' strategy to increase sales and maximize cart value.
- Chatbots enabled by machine learning could also be implemented to assist with other time-consuming tasks, such as the customer education aspects of customer acquisition.
### Ethics in machine learning
##### Equity and fairness in machine learning
Recommendation algorithms can be extremely accurate, but they can also miss the mark. For example, one limitation of recommendation tools is the problem of popularity bias, which is the phenomenon of more popular items being recommended too frequently. This leaves the majority of other items which might be just as pleasing to users, not getting the attention they deserve.
As machine learning application in the real world increases, there's greater potential for models to have unintended consequences. As a data professional, it's important that you prioritize fairness in the data that you have and use. 
Part of this responsible data stewardship is taking steps to reduce the potential of unintended consequences of your machine learning applications. Data professionals must also consider risk. They may need to make decisions that could expose a business and the people it serves to negative consequences. Recognizing the potential for bias will help to minimize risk. Bias in machine learning is particularly deceptive because it stems from human bias. But because a computer makes the prediction, it's easy for the result to seem objective. Often, the bias is unintentional.
The negative consequences are the results of bias in the training data, which is inherited from bias in the data collection process. By building your model using this data, you ended up with a dataset with a class imbalance. In other words, the input data was biased before the modelling even began. This is just one example of how machine learning solutions have the potential to carry with them unintended consequences related to equity and fairness. Therefore, there are some fundamental questions to ask at each step of the modelling process to help reduce the risk of a model causing harm.
##### Build ethical models
Its critical for data professionals to ensure that their models are ethical. Predictive models are central to machine-learning and have the potential to do a lot of good, but comes with risk. There's no simple guide for this because there are so many different kinds of models that are applied to a variety of tasks. As a data professional at any level, you'll probably have to make decisions about models that carry ethical implications no matter what problem you're trying to solve.
Let's explore some of the questions that you should ask during the PACE framework:
###### Planning stage
- What is the purpose of your model?
- How will the predictions be used?
- By whom?
- Who is affected?
- How harmful or significant could effects be?
###### Analyze stage
Is your data...
- Appropriate?
- Well sourced?
- Representative?
###### Construct stage
How important is it that your model's predictions be explained?
###### Execute stage
- Do your model or predictions make sense?
- Are predictions fair?
- Is somebody responsible for reviewing or monitoring model pre-and-post-deployment?
###### Consent
Make sure you're considering the issue of consent at every stage of the PACE process. Some questions to ask for consent are:
- Do you have consent to use personal data?
- Is there a way for a person to withdraw consent?
- Are people aware of what you're doing with their data?
Few data professionals will be responsible for answering all these questions themselves, but nearly every data professional must answer some of them. It's important for you to always keep in mind. When you ask the right questions at each stage of the PACE workflow, you help to ensure your models are good for business and good for everyone involved.
### Machine learning resources for data professionals
##### Resources to answer programming questions
In the data field, almost no one knows what they're doing 100 percent of their time. Even the most experienced professionals encounter issues with their code or the data analysis process itself, and need to search for answers. That's why its so important to understand the available resources that can help you find the solutions you need. So, what can you do when you encounter a problem as a data professional as you prepare for analysis?
- The first step might be searching for the error, as most problems will have been encountered by other developers before. Take the error output and search for it online on platforms like Stack Overflow.
- Another resource is documentation for the package or module you're working with. This is an in-depth guide written by the developers who created the package, documentation features, specific information about various functions, and features, and usually includes helpful examples.
- Kaggle is another resource that many data professionals use at some point in their journey. It features an online community with tens of thousands of public datasets, along with Python notebooks that provide examples of how to conquer a variety of analysis. Beginners in the data science industry, use it because it offers tutorials, and datasets to learn, and the practice of machine-learning techniques. For data professionals already in the industry for many years, they use Kaggle to learn about new advances in technology, and keep their skills sharp.
- When you encounter an error message or other coding issue, it's also a best practice to consider whether your tools are up-to-date. By staying proactive you can prevent the problems in the first place. Make sure that you have correct versions of all your software and tools.
These resources are just a few to consider when you need help with your programming. You'll find developers collaborating all over the internet. The more you learn, the easier it will get to find solutions yourself.
##### Find solutions online
Knowing how to troubleshoot problems you encounter and where to find updates to packages will make you a more confident, efficient, and effective data professional. 
###### A word of caution
Not everything you read online is accurate. When seeking guidance from online resources, it's important to be mindful of the source of any information you find. The field of data science is expanding greatly due to its increasing accessibility, rapid development, and capacity to transform the world around us. It also offers many exciting job opportunities. This surge of interest has led to an ever-growing body of online knowledge and resources for data practitioners. But, anybody can write a blog about data science and post it online, and anybody can respond to a question in a data science forum. Although the truth usually rises to the top, there's still plenty of misinformation on the internet. Always consider the credibility of the source of the information and try to cross-verify any claims you encounter. Don't believe everything you read.
